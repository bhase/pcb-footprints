This repository contains some footprints for pcb
http://pcb.gpleda.org/index.html

I do not know the origin of the 2terminal and 3terminal footprints, they are
around since a few years. If anybody recognizes them, please give me a hint
that I can give credits to the original creator.

The footprint SMA_LAY.fp is taken from
